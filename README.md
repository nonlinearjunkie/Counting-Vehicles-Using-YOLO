# Counting Vehicles Using Darknet
This project counts number of vehicles with individual counts of each vehicle using YOLO algorithm.
 It uses Darknet architechture for this purpouse.
 For counting number of vehicles initially all the objects are detected are detected and then compared with list defined consisting of different vehicles and then counted.It might be used for Real time traffic survilleance and vehicle density estimation.

# Prerequisites
